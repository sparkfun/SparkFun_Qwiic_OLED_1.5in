--------------------------

The SparkFun Qwiic OLED Display offers a sharp, professional user interface in a compact 1.5-inch form factor. Featuring a 128x128-pixel resolution, this monochrome white-on-black display uses Chip-on-Glass (COG) OLED technology, providing a 1:1 aspect ratio and a high-pixel-density canvas ideal for custom graphics and data plotting. Because OLED pixels emit their own light, no bulky backlight is required, resulting in superior image quality and "deeper blacks" compared to traditional LCDs.
