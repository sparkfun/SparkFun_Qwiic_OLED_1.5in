In this Quick Start guide we'll connect the SparkFun OLED Display (1.5in., 128x128) to a SparkFun IoT RedBoard - ESP32 and use the SparkFun OLED Arduino library to produce basic images and text on the display.

If you're not familiar with using breakout and development boards or the Arduino IDE, refer to the [Hardware](./hardware_overview.md) & [Software](./arduino_setup.md) sections for a detailed overview of the board along with instructions on soldering to and connecting the breakout, installing and using the SparkFun MY1690X MP3 Decoder Arduino Library.
