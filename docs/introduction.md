The SparkFun Qwiic OLED Display (1.5in., 128x128) is a compact, square monochrome white on black 128x128 pixel display. This COG (chip on glass) OLED display does not have a back light layer (unlike LCDs) so it’s thinner, consumes less power, and has higher contrast.


You'll need the following items to follow along with this tutorial:

* [SparkFun Qwiic OLED Display (1.5in., 128x128)(https://www.sparkfun.com/products/29530)
* [SparkFun RedBoard Plus](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-redboard-plus.html) or other Arduino development board
* [Qwiic Cable]()
* [USB-C Cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/reversible-usb-a-to-c-cable-0-8m.html)



## Topics Covered

This document contains three main sections: **Quickstart Guide**, **Hardware** and **Software**. 

The Quickstart Guide assumes a working knowledge of how to assemble and use the Qwiic OLED Display with a Qwiic-enabled development board. It covers basic Qwiic assembly then jumps right into getting the necessary software packages installed to start uploading code and displaying text and images in just a few short minutes.

The Hardware pages cover a hardware overview that provides a detailed overview of the Qwiic OLED Display (1.5in., 128x128) covering all the major components on the board in detail as well as a hardware assembly page which goes over the steps required to assemble and use board with a compatible Arudino board.

The Software pages give instructions on installing the SparkFun OLED Arduino library and using the examples included in it.

## Resources and Documentation

You'll find the board design files (KiCad files & schematic), relevant documentation (datasheets, white papers, etc.) and other helpful links in the **Resources**. Lastly, the **Support** section includes a Troubleshooting page that includes any helpful tips specific to this board as well as information on how to receive technical support from SparkFun.
