## Qwiic OLED Arduino Library

The SparkFun Qwiic OLED Arduino library supports several different OLED breakouts. Each example includes definitions for all supported OLEDs so make sure you've adjusted those definitions to switch to the 1.5" OLED. Comment out the line for the Qwiic Micro OLED and uncomment the line for the Qwiic 1.5" OLED like the code below:

``` c++
//QwiicMicroOLED myOLED;
//QwiicTransparentOLED myOLED;
//QwiicNarrowOLED myOLED;
//Qwiic1in3OLED myOLED;
Qwiic1in5OLED myOLED;
```
