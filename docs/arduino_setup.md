## SparkFun Qwiic OLED Arduino Library

The SparkFun Qwiic OLED Arduino Library is a single graphics module that supports all SparkFun OLED boards based on the SSD1306 from Solomon Systech. You can install the library with the Arduino [Library manager](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/ide-v2-installing-a-library/) tool by searching for "SparkFun Qwiic OLED". If you'd prefer a manual install, you can download a ZIP of the library [here](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_OLED_Arduino_Library/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
